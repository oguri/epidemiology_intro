# epidemiology_intro

Follow-up materials of my seminar on the introduction to compartmental models in epidemiology in May 2020 given at University of Tokyo Theoretical Astrophysics (UTAP) group. The slides of the seminar are available [here](utapseminar2020.pdf). Specifically, I discussed the SIR model, SEIR model, and SEIRS model. A jupyter notebook is provided for each of the models.
